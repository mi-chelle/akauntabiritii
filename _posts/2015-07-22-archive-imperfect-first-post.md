Perfection. That's what holds me back.

That sentence seems incorrect. "That's what". Is that right? Wait. Is right right or is it correct to say correct?

This holds me back. What will people find fault with? What should I triple check before publishing? *spends twenty minutes Googling "right vs correct" just to be sure*

People can't pile on a put-down if they don't see you. *Googles whether to use a hyphen with "put-down"*…*Googles whether to us double or single quotes when emphasising a word.*

I want my writing to be perfect before letting it out in to the world. Basically, I'm terrified of criticism–scared of incorrect punctuation; afraid to offend someone; worried I won't have enough synonyms.

It took me my 20s to realise that some people just criticise–at random. I'm 30. Almost 31. It's time I stopped being anxious about what people think. My Nan isn't afraid to say what she's thinking. I want to feel her confidence (though I think I'll keep my filter).

While we're on my faults, my tendency to procrastinate needs work, too. While writing this article, I checked my phone(s) 17-ish times, watched half an NRL game (The Rabbitohs were getting owned), poured...4 gin and sodas? and gave The New Girl and Orange is the New Black another chance on Netflix. I still don't get why people like these shows.

It'll be a long road, but I'm done with stalling. I paid $300 for this blog theme and its installation. (Thanks, Aussie dollar.) There's a motivational kickstart.

Screw perfection. You live one life and, right this moment, I want to drink gin and write.*
