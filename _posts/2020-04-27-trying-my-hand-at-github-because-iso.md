I'm going back to basics and dumping high-maintenance Wordpress.

It's Wordpress's fault I don't blog, like ever.

This is my attempt at creating a space for a regularly updated blog. It's only been 10 years. I'm sure __now__ I'll keep it up. It's all about the tools, right? Not the technique. Yeah, that's it.

So I'm also learning Github + Jekyll for the first time, re-learning HTML and CSS, and becoming really skilled in long-tail YouTube searches.  

Other motivations for taking up another project I have no time for include: 

- To get hands-on with the stuff I feel I should know a little something about as a content strategist
- To drop an expensive and painful hosting service connected to a site I never update
- To share my mistakes, frustrations and lessons as a content person trying to make it in the world

This may or may not be my first and only post. Like my kindle paperwhite full of samples, my list of empty promises to myself runs off the page.
